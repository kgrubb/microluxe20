## Psionic Powers (Psion)

Psionic characters can manifest any of their powers, so long as the power level is equal to or below their class level. Unlike spells, all aspects of a power do not automatically scale with level. Instead, they are augmented with additional Hit Points (HP). The augmenting HP cost is noted under each power's entry. Psions are casters, so they can select a "signature" power per power level from 1st upward, reducing its cost by 2 HP. This also means healing spells cast on an injured psion only heal ¼ of the given amount.

The combined HP cost for manifesting and augmenting a power cannot exceed the character's psionic class level. Thus, a 3rd level psion could manifest a level 1 power by spending 1 HP, and augment it by spending 2 additional HP for a total HP cost of 3. Temporary HP cannot be used to manifest powers.
- **Psionic vs. Magical Effects:** Powers interact with spells and spells interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal spell-like ability interacts with another spell or spell-like ability. For example, detect magic detects psionics and dispel psionics dispels magic.
