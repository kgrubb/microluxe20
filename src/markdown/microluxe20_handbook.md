# Introduction

Microluxe20 is a minimalist tabletop role-playing game designed with simplicity in mind. Using an easy-to-grasp, yet extremely robust stat/skill framework, Microluxe20 allows for crafting exciting encounters that are fun and fluid, emphasizing storytelling and player interaction over the traditional "straight-jacket" skill systems found in many modern tabletop games. Keeping compatibility in mind, OGL/d20 supplements should work out of the box, without any conversions; in fact, SRD/OGL adventures with any incompatibilities can be converted _on the fly_ with almost no effort! The entire character sheet fits on one sheet of paper, meaning character creation and management is extremely quick and easy. Microluxe20 is great for one-shot adventures, or teaching new players about tabletop gaming. However, unlike many one-shot styled tabletop games, it is also robust enough to cater to full-fledged campaign-style games as well, especially because of its compatibility with other OGL/d20 content.

## First Steps

### What is a Role-Playing Game?

A role-playing game (RPG) is a cooperative narration game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting, deciding freely which actions to take as their fictional alter-ego. The Game Master(GM), the main narrator of the game, describes the game world and its inhabitants. The other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes. Actions taken within the game succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. For example:

**GM:** “You’re walking along a path in a small wood when you hear noises coming from behind a large bush of vegetation. A sparkle of light reveals something shiny...”

**Now it’s your turn:** Are you a fearful adventurer that decides to run for his life? Are you brave enough to search in the wood? Maybe you’re a warrior that grabs his sword, sure that this is an ambush. Or maybe you’re a smart and cunning rogue, climbing silently on a tree to look at what’s behind the plants. Maybe you’re a powerful wizard that casts a spell to clearly see through all obstacles in front of you. The possibilities are limitless! It’s up to you to decide!

### How to Play

When playing Microluxe20, the game will follow a basic pattern:

1. The GM shows or describes the world. The GM tells the players where they are and what they are doing, explaining any lore or recent happenings. For example, the GM may describe a small town that the players have just entered, telling them that they see a small stable, an inn and a few farm houses. The GM may elaborate, saying there are mountains in the distance, or bloody footprints on the ground near one of the farm house entrances.

2. The players decide on what they want to do, and describe their actions to the GM. Outside of combat, one player may speak for the whole party, or maybe each player has their own plans on what they want to do or investigate. The players don't necessarily need to take turns, but the GM still needs to be able to listen to each player's decision and resolve it. Decision resolution can be simple (for example, if the player simply wants to open the farm door, the GM can just tell the player what they see inside) or complex (perhaps the door is locked and the player must work out a way to get inside). In more complex situations, the GM may make use of dice rolls to determine the outcome of the player's action.

3. After the player decides on their action and describes it, the GM responds with the results of the player's action. Once the GM describes the outcome, the pattern starts over again, returning to step 1.

This pattern is used for any conflict resolution, aside from combat. Once combat begins in a situation, the game switches to a more rigid and structured ruleset, where players take turns deciding on and completing actions. Outside of combat, this basic pattern continues to keep everything fluid and simple, continually adapting to the adventure's storyline.

### Items Needed

To play Microluxe20, you will need **paper**, **pencils**, and a conventional set of **d20 tabletop dice**. The dice required to play are a 4-sided die (d4), 6-sided die (d6), 8-sided die (d8), 10-sided die (d10), 12-sided die (d12), 20-sided die (d20), and a Percentile 10-sided die (d10 showing 00/10/20/30, etc).

When referencing dice in the game, dice rolls are often abbreviated to something like "d6" or "d20", where the number after the "d" represents the number of sides on the die. Numbers in front of the "d" dictate how many times the die should be rolled.

For example, “3d6 + 5” means you roll three 6-sided dice, add their results together, then add 5 to the total.

# Character Creation

When creating a character in Microluxe20, you will need to decide on a race and class. After choosing your character's race and class, you can configure their stats and skills.

## Races

Terador has a wealth of races to choose from, each with their unique history. While the Mir are the most common race in Terador, the many other races are fairly commonplace to see as well. When creating a character, your player will be one of the major races of Terador.

<!-- $data races.yml races -->

## Classes

Classes define your character's way of life. Your character's class helps shape his/her combat style and methods of overcoming various obstacles. Your class provides a pathway, granting special powers and features for your character.

**Fighters** wear and use any kind of armor, shield, and weapon. They gain a +3 bonus to Physical and add +1 to all attack and damage rolls. This increases by +1 at 5th level and every five levels onward. They also gain additional HP equal to their STR bonus every time they level up. Fighters gain the _Cleave_ ability at level 5. If the Fighter's melee attack drops/slays a foe, the fighter gets one additional attack against another opponent within range. This ability can compound, meaning if one swing kills the second foe, the Fighter can continue to attack until he/she either misses or doesn't kill the foe with the attack.

**Rogues** can use light armor, can use bucklers, and can use simple weapons and complex light weapons. They have a +3 bonus to Guile. Rogues can _Sneak Attack_. If they successfully sneak (usually Guile+DEX, but depends on situation) up on a foe they can add their Guile skill rank to the damage of their first attack. Rogues gain the _Evade_ ability at level 5. Any save that a rogue succeeds cannot deal damage to the rogue. For example, some spells deal half-damage even if the target saves successfully. With Evade, the rogue would not take any damage as long as he/she saved successfully.

**Mages** wear no armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can cast arcane spells (Mage), and gain a +3 bonus to Knowledge.

**Clerics** can wear light or medium armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They cast divine spells (Cleric) and gain a +3 bonus to Communication. A Cleric can _Turn Undead_ with a successful Magic Attack. The DC for the action is the current HP of the Undead. If the DC is exceeded by 10 it is destroyed. This can be used (2 + Level + MIND Bonus) times per day.

**Paladins** wear and use any kind of armor, shield, and weapon. They gain +1 to Physical and a +2 bonus to Communication. They are immune to diseases and apply a +1 bonus to all saving throws (this increases by +1 at 5th level and every 5 levels onward). Paladins can _Detect Evil_ within 60 ft. at will and can heal up to 2 HP per level per day by _Laying on Hands_.

**Rangers** wear light or medium armor, can use shields, and can use simple weapons, complex ranged weapons, and complex one-handed weapons. They gain +1 to hit and +1 damage with ranged weapons and only incur a -1 to hit penalty when fighting with 2 weapons. They have a +1 bonus to Guile and a +2 bonus to Physical. Rangers gain the _Trapper_ ability at level 5. When dealing with trap-related dice rolls (such as dodging a trap or searching for traps), a ranger gains a +2 bonus.

**Illusionists** wear no armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can cast arcane spells (Illusionist) and gain a +2 bonus to Communication and a +1 bonus to Guile.

**Druids** wear any non-metal armor, can use non-metal shields, and can use simple weapons. They cast divine spells (Druid) and gain +2 to Knowledge and +1 to Physical. Druids are immune to the spell-like effects of woodland fey. At 3rd level a Druid can _Pass Without Trace_ (be untraceable) at will. At 7th level a Druid can assume the form of any small or medium sized animal up to 3 times per day. A Druid heals 2 HP per level when changing back into his/her human form.

**Bards** wear light armor, can use bucklers, and can use simple weapons and complex light weapons. They gain +2 to Communication and +1 to Guile. A Bard has the _Performance_ ability, allowing him/her to counter sound-based effects within a 30 ft. radius. A Bard can use his/her song to _Charm Person_ or _Remove Fear_ (vs DC) up to 3 times (total) per day. Beginning at 6th level, a Bard casts spells as either a Druid or Illusionist (player's choice) of 5 levels lower.

**Psions** can use light armor, can not use shields, and can use simple weapons. They can manifest Psion powers and gain +2 to Knowledge and +1 to Communication.

## Stats

There are 3 core stats that define a character:

**Strength** (STR): Strength represents the physical prowess of the character. It defines their resilience and toughness as well as how hard they can hit.

**Dexterity** (DEX): Dexterity represents the character's coordination, precision, agility, reflexes, balance and movement.

**Mind** (MIND): Mind represents the character's analytical thinking, as well as their wisdom, memory, knowledge of lore, and general intelligence.

When creating a character, you get 10 points to freely spend on your core stats, as long as no single stat is higher than 6. For example, a Fighter may choose to have 6 STR, 4 DEX, and 0 MIND.

**Stat Bonus:** For any stat, the Stat Bonus is that stat's value divided by two, rounding down. If the stat is negative, round towards negative infinity.

**Hit Points (HP)**: Hit Points determine how healthy a character is. As they are injured or hurt, their HP depletes. To determine a character's starting HP, use the following formula:

	10 + STR stat + 1d6(with a minimum of 3).

If a player's character is damaged to the point where their HP reaches zero (or below zero), the character becomes "downed", or unconscious and near death, with 0 HP. Further damage directly reduces their normally highest stat (either STR, DEX, or MIND). If that stat drops below -10, the character dies. While down, at the start of your turn, roll a d6. You have 3 chances (1 chance per turn) to roll above a 3. If successful, you are stable and return to 1 HP. Otherwise, if unsuccessful 3 turns, the character dies.

Sometimes damage in combat is dealt directly to a character's Stats instead of Hit Points. If any stat reaches -10 or below, the character is downed and treated as if they were reduced to 0 HP. Stats damaged directly or while downed will return to their normal levels after a long rest (4 hours).

**Speed** comes in 3 tiers. You are either Slow(20ft.), Normal(30ft.) or Fast(35ft.). Speed is determined by the game master and can be affected by spells and conditions. Typically, Fighters or Paladins with Heavy armor are Slow, Rogues and Rangers are Fast, and the rest are Normal speed. (5ft. is approximately 1 "Square")

**Armor Class (AC):** A character's Armor Class represents their ability to evade or block physical attacks. The higher a character's AC, the more difficult it is to land a damaging blow. A character's Armor Class is determined by this formula:

	10 + DEX bonus + Armor bonus + Racial bonus (if applicable).


## Skills & Saves

There are 4 skills: **Physical**, **Guile**, **Knowledge**, and **Communication**. Roll higher than the given Difficulty Class to succeed.

**Skill Rank** = any bonus due to your class or race + any allocated points.

**Skill Roll** = d20 + skill rank + whatever stat bonus is most applicable to the use + situation modifiers

For example, Climbing would use Physical + STR bonus. Dodging a falling rock is Physical + DEX bonus. Finding a trap is Guile + MIND bonus. Disabling a trap is Guile + DEX bonus.

**Save Roll** = d20 + stat bonus + situation modifiers

For compatibility purposes, the 3 saves in Microluxe20 (STR save, DEX save, and MIND save), directly match Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves (often called "saving throws") found in other SRD-based games.

<h2 class="page-break"> Level Advancement </h2>

Characters gain XP (or Experience Points) from defeating monsters, disarming traps, or from handling situations in innovative ways, at the GM's discretion. XP is awarded to all characters who take part in the encounter.

**XP Gained** = Hit Dice of defeated monsters, or the given XP for the trap, situation, etc. Add +1 for each doubling of the number of foes.

**Examples:** Kobolds have 1 hit die, so 1 kobold = 1 XP. 2 kobolds are double the amount, so 2 kobolds = 2 XP (1 XP for first kobold + 1 XP for doubling). 4 kobolds are double the amount again, so 4 kobolds = 3 XP ( 1 XP for first kobold + 1 XP for doubling to 2 + 1 XP for doubling from 2 to 4). A Black Bear has 3 hit die, so 1 Black Bear = 3 XP. 2 Black Bears = 4 XP. 4 Black Bears = 5 XP.

As characters participate in encounters, they will begin to accumulate XP. Characters advance to the next level when they have gained XP equal to 10 times their current level. After advancing, the total XP is reset to 0. If a character has more XP than is required for the next level, keep the excess XP and add it after resetting the character's XP to 0. For example, if a level 1 character has 8XP and is awarded 4XP, the character advances to level 2 with 2XP.

**Example:** The 1st level adventurers have just completed a dungeon adventure, and defeated five 1 XP encounters, a 2 XP trap and the 3 XP leader. That's a total of 10 XP, so they all advance to level 2. They need to gain another 20 XP to reach Level 3.

Each level adds:

* +1d6 to Hit Points (with a minimum of 3). Fighters also get additional HP equal to their STR bonus.

* +2 points to spend on skills. When upgrading skills, you cannot add more points to a skill if it is higher than or equal to your character's level + 5.

* If your character's level divides by three (ex: level 3,6,9,etc.) add 1 point to STR, DEX or MIND.

* Fighters gain +1 to their attack and damage rolls at levels 5,10,15,etc.

* New spell and power levels are unlocked at levels 2,4,6,8,etc.

## Combat

When entering combat, the pace of the game shifts from the free-form nature of exploration to tightly structured units of time called 'rounds', in which each character gets one turn. On their turn, characters may move up to their maximum speed and take one additional action (attack, cast a spell, move again, speak with someone, etc.), unless they are immobilized, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated.

The order in which characters take their turns in combat is determined by rolling d20 + DEX bonus for **initiative** at the start of each round (ties are settled with a re-roll).

When making an attack, roll a d20, adding the appropriate **attack bonus** for the action. If the resulting total is greater than your opponent's Armor Class (AC), it's a hit. Natural 20 is automatically a critical, dealing additional damage equal to your weapon's maximum damage. Melee attack bonuses are used for martial weapons, Missile attack bonuses are used for ranged combat, and Magic attack bonuses are used for staves and other magical items with special powers.

**Melee attack bonus** = STR bonus + Character Level

**Missile attack bonus** = DEX bonus + Character Level

**Magic attack bonus** = MIND bonus + Character Level

If the total attack bonus is +6 or more, a second attack can be made with a -5 penalty to the attack bonus. If the total bonus is +11 or more a third attack can be made at a -10 penalty. For example, if the total bonus is +12, three attacks can be made at +12/+7/+2.

Fighters and Rogues may use DEX bonus + Level (Missile attack bonus) as Melee attack bonus instead when wielding a light weapon. Fighters, Rogues, Bards, and Rangers may wield 2 light weapons and attack with both in a round, if they take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls that round. Rangers take a -1 penalty instead.

For each attack that hits, roll the damage die code on your weapon and subtract the resulting total from your opponent's HP. When wielding a Complex Melee weapon, add your STR bonus to the damage total.

**Example:** Your Human Paladin has hit an enemy Orc with his Greatsword (2d6, Complex). He rolls two six-sided die, getting 4+5 for a total of 9. Since it is a Complex weapon, he adds his strength bonus of +2, for 11 damage total. The Orc, having a meager 9 HP left, is killed instantly.

When all characters (including Gamemaster's characters) have taken their turn, the round is over. If there are any opponents left alive or not incapacitated, a new round begins. Otherwise, combat is over.

## Spells

Spellcasters may cast any of their class spells as long as the spell level is equal to or below their class level. Casting a spell of any kind costs Hit Points. The cost is equal to the level of the spell being cast. Unless specified otherwise, spellcasting does not require the player to make a dice roll.

Once a spellcaster has cast a spell in an encounter, they enter a state called "arcane (or divine) influence". While in this state, their HP *cannot* be healed normally until they have a short rest. Healing spells cast on an injured caster under arcane/divine influence only heal ¼ of the given amount. Spellcasters automatically exit their influenced state after 1 hour of rest.

There is no need to memorize spells in advance. Just because a character can cast any spell, doesn't mean that they should. Choose spells that suit the character. Select one "signature" spell per spell level from 1st upward that they prefer to use over any other. These spells are easier to cast due to familiarity, costing 2 less HP to use.

**Spell Difficulty Class (DC)** for all spells: 10 + Caster Level + Caster's MIND bonus

When a spell is cast, the target of the spell must make a relevant DC save (d20 + relevant stat bonus), unless the spell states that it requires a different or more specific save. If the target scores lower than the spell's DC, they are affected by the spell. For example, if the spell forms spikes that protrude from the ground, the target may make a DEX save to try and escape the spell's effects.

Here are three ways for spell casters to add a little more variety:

**Extending** makes a spell last twice as long as it normally would. An Extended spell costs an additional 2 HP.

**Empowering** makes a spell do 50% more damage than normal. An Empowered spell costs an additional 4 HP.

**Widening** makes a spell's area of effect twice as big as normal. A Widened spell costs an additional 6 HP.

## Magic Items

*Author's Note:* This section is intended to establish a common baseline for magical items. Gamemasters are encouraged to customize or even ignore this section as needed to fit their setting.

Magical items can be broadly divided into two categories: Active and Passive. Active magical items require some action on the part of the character to make use of their magical effects, while passive items provide their effect at all times. Using an active item may require a skill check of some sort, and may sometimes consume HP in the same fashion spellcasting does.

### Common Active Items:

**Staves:** The main tool of a spellcaster, the staff is a focus used to harness magical energy. Spellcasters usually require a staff to cast a spell. Staves may also contain one or more spells that the caster would not normally have access to; these spells can only be cast while wielding the staff.

**Rods:** Usually employed for easier metamagic, rods may contain a single spell or magical effect. This spell can be cast by anyone for the appropriate HP cost, but non-spellcasting characters do so at +2 or more to the difficulty. Rods with a metamagic effect may be used in tandem with staves when casting a spell.

**Wands:** Sometimes described as "magic-in-a-bottle", a wand contains a combination of a single spell and a set amount of charges. While there are charges left, any character may use the wand to cast the contained spell at the expense of a charge. Wands can be recharged, but usually require a significant HP cost for each charge.

**Potions:** A single-use magical item, potions consist of a bottled magical liquid. When consumed, a potion confers a magical effect on the character that drank it.

**Scrolls:** Similar to Potions, scrolls are a single-use item that allow any character to cast a single spell simply by reading it. Spellcasters may use Read Magic to decipher a scroll without casting it.

### Common Passive Items:

**Amulets, Charms, Rings, etc:** Various items of jewelery may be enchanted to provide a magical effect. Most items of this sort provide a bonus to a stat or skill, but more spectacular effects are possible.

**Armor and Weapons:** Enchanted armor and weapons are usually the mark of a wealthy adventurer or noble, and usually provide some form of passive effect, ranging from a simple 'torchlight' effect to damage reduction, elemental resistances or bonuses, and more.

<h3 class="page-break"> Creating Magic Items </h3>

The process to enchant an item with a magical effect differs slightly from item to item (and at the Gamemaster's discretion) but they all follow a similar pattern in their creation. Most enchantments will require access to special tools of some kind - potions will require a cauldron and beakers, wands and rods require tools to carve the magical trace-work into their surface, and jewelery requires fine tools to shape the item and socket gems into their proper places.

To begin the process, the player needs to have the base form of the item and purchase materials to perform the enchantment, and the spellcaster performing the enchantment must know the spell or use a scroll with the wanted spell. All materials used in the process are consumed, as well as any scrolls used as a source.

The enchantment process will require a spellcaster to infuse the item with HP equal to 10 times the cost of the spell or effect being enchanted with. A spellcaster can infuse up to 50% of their maximum HP into items each day; it takes a full hour to infuse 5 HP, and the character cannot regain HP lost until taking a long rest. Only one character may infuse an item at a time.

When creating a scroll, the infusion cost is reduced to 5 times the HP cost of the spell being written down.

When creating an item with magical charges, the maximum number of charges the item can hold is determined by rolling 1d20 + Level. Each charge requires 5 times the HP cost of the spell, but the item may be recharged at any point.

When the infusion process is finished, the player rolls MIND+Knowledge, and the result of the roll determines the effectiveness of the enchantment.

| Result: | Effect |
| :------ | :----- |
| Natural 1 | Critical Failure! The item is destroyed and the enchanter is reduced to 0 HP and is Unconscious. |
| 2-9 | Failure! All materials used are destroyed, but the base item is undamaged. |
| 10-15 | Minor Success! The item is enchanted, but the user must make a DC 15 Magic roll to use the item. |
| 15+ | Success! The item is successfully enchanted, and no other effect occurs. |
| Natural 20 | Critical Success! The item is successfully enchanted, and gains +50% to its effectiveness. |

**Example:** Your 3rd-level elven Mage wants to imbue a wand with Prestidigitation. This is a 1st-level Mage spell, so it will take 10 HP to enchant the wand. You also want to infuse it with one charge to start, bringing the total HP cost to 15. Your Mage has a 30 HP maximum, so it will take only one day to complete, and he must focus on infusing the wand for a full three hours. You roll 1d20 + your Mage's level, getting an 11 for the maximum number of charges the wand can hold. You roll MIND+Knowledge when he has finished infusing the wand and - Presto! - you get a 17! The wand is successfully crafted, holding 1 / 11 charges.

</div>

## Resting & Recuperating

After combat, players must rest to regain their stamina. There are 2 forms of resting:

**Short Rest:** Resting for 1-4 hours constitutes a short rest. Characters heal up to 1/4 of their HP (rounded up). Spellcasters are no longer under arcane/divine influence.

**Long Rest:** Resting for over 4 hours constitutes a long rest. Characters heal all of their HP and short-term side effects. Spellcasters also lose their arcane/divine influence.

## Heroism

**Heroism** is intended to relieve some of the power incompatibilities with some d20 adventure types. If you find that the party is consistently too weak, try adding Heroism. **Heroism** is a bonus equal to the character's level that may be applied to one of the following actions three times per day: Attack Bonus, Damage, Saving Throw, Skill Check, or Spell DC.

# Appendix

## Basic Mass Combat
Most combat is carried out one-on-one, with each set of stats (HP, AC, combat bonuses, etc) applying to a single character or creature. However, combat can be extended by using Combat Scale. Combat Scale is a multiplier that shows the amount of characters or creatures relative to their normal single-unit size. It is only applied to damage in combat between units of different size. Hit Points, AC and all other stats remain the same.

For example, a unit of 20 Goblin warriors will have CSx5 as per the table below. The combat stats are still HD1d8+1 (5HP), AC15, Morningstar +2 (1d6) or Javelin +3 (1d4). Against anything with the same Combat Scale (for example, a unit of 15 Elves), combat is resolved normally as if it was one goblin against one elf.

|COMBAT SCALE CHART||||||||||
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Number in Unit**|2-5|6-10|11-20|21-40|41-80|81-160|161-320|321-640|etc.|
|**Combat Scale**|x3|x4|x5|x6|x7|x8|x9|x10|etc.|

Combat Scale comes into play when battling against forces of a different size. It acts as a multiplier for damage taken, and also divides any damage given. If the battle started between units of different CS, reduce the size of the Combat Scale as Hit Points as lost. For example, if the twenty Goblin warriors above are reduced to 2HP, they have lost over half of their unit, so they are now CSx4. When down to just 1HP, they are CSx3 with only 5 goblins remaining.

If the Combat Scale becomes the same for all opponents, resolve combat normally; the playing field is now level.

### Calculating Experience

Experience is gained from taking part in a battle equal to the Hit Die of the opponent, +1 for each CS higher than your own. For example, a member of the 20-strong Knights of the Rose (CSx5) will earn 3 XP after defeating an army of 35 Gnolls (a 2 Hit Die creature, CSx6).

### Mass Combat Example: Knights vs Dragon

The 500-strong Knights of the Rose stand ready against the young Dragon. They are CSx10, while the Dragon, a single creature, is just CSx1, though formidable.

500 Knights: HD2d8+4 (14HP), AC18, Lance +7 (1d10+4) or Longsword +6 (1d8+2), CSx10
Dragon: HD13×12+39 (123HP), AC21, Bite +20 (2d6+7) or Breath 10d10 DC24

The Dragon flies high above and breathes flames across their formation for 46HP damage. The knights dive for cover beneath their shields (Physical + DEX to dodge DC24. They roll 25, barely making it). They take ½ damage – 23HP, divided by CSx10 for 2HP. The Knights are down to 12HP.

They ready their horses to charge as the Dragon lands, the thunder of 2,000 hooves makes the young dragon hesitate. They hit (rolled 18+7 = 25 vs. AC21), scoring 11 damage, CSx10 for a massive 110HP damage. The Dragon is down to 13HP against the small army, bleeding from the impact of many lances. It roars and lunges in anger, biting savagely. It hits easily (rolled 6+20 = 26 vs. AC18) for 17 damage, divided by 10 = 2HP. The Knights are down to 10HP. If they fall below 7HP they will be at half their numbers and down to CSx9.

They draw their Longswords and surround the downed Dragon, though their weapons do little more than scratch the drake's hide (6 + 8 = 14, a miss). The Dragon turns to bite again, and rolls a Natural 20. It's a critical, so the Knights take 19HP damage, CSx10 so 2HP lost. They are down to 8HP after watching a few more of their number be gobbled up.

Their longswords bit true (18 +6 = 24 vs. AC21), for 6HP damage, CSx10 for a total of 60HP against the drake. It's down, finally, though the Knights have lost 143 (500×4/14) of their number in the battle. They commend their souls in valor.
